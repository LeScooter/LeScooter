## Hello there.

I'm Scott, but I usually go by Scooter online. I'm a software engineer from Scotland, formerly working at Hypixel Studios on the much-anticipated game, Hytale.

Welcome to my personal GitHub. Here, you'll find a mix of my past projects and some random experiments. While my most recent and exciting work is probably private, there's still plenty to explore and enjoy.
